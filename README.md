This project was developed for educational purposes to demonstrate front-end UI/UX design concepts in a bookstore context.

## 📌 Notes

- This project does not use any frameworks (e.g., React, Vue).
- All state is simulated with front-end logic; no actual data persistence or backend.

This project was collaboratively developed by a dedicated team of four members, each contributing their unique skills to bring the website to life:

Ayindla Rithika - Created the Home page (before login/sign in).
Partishtha Mahajan - Created the Home page (personalised).
Kolluru Siddarth - implemented the Log in, Sign in, forgot pass in the Navigation bar.
Mahimaluru Lakshmi Narashima Athreya - implemented the Hierarchy, profile page and the settings, gener, log out in the Navigation bar.

This collaborative effort showcases each member’s contribution toward building a user-centered and aesthetically pleasing Bookstore UI.
